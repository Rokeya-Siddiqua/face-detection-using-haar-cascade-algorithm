So what is Haar Cascade? It is an Object Detection Algorithm used to identify faces in an image or a real time video. The algorithm uses edge or line detection features proposed by Viola and Jones in their research paper “Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features” published in 2001. The algorithm is given a lot of positive images consisting of faces, and a lot of negative images not consisting of any face to train on them. The model created from this training is available at the OpenCV GitHub repository  https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades. The repository has the models stored in XML files, and can be read with the OpenCV methods. These include models for face detection, eye detection, upper body and lower body detection, license plate detection etc. Below we see some of the concepts proposed by Viola and Jones in their research.
